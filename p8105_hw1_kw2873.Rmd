# problem 1: datafram


```{r}

  s = rnorm(8)
  v_logi = s > 0
  v_ch = c("A", "B", "C", "D","E", "F", "G", "H")
  v_fa = c("AB", "B", "O", "B","B", "O", "AB", "B")
  
library(tidyverse)
example_df = tibble(
  samp = s,
  vec_logical = v_logi,
  vec_char = v_ch,
  vec_factor = v_fa
  )
### out put of the example_data fram
example_df
### take the mean of each variables
mean(s)
mean(v_logi)
mean(v_ch)
mean(v_fa)
```
the mean of my sample is `r mean(s)`

the mean of my logical vector is `r mean(v_logi)`

the mean of my character vector is `r mean(v_ch)`

the mean of my factor vector is `r mean(v_fa)`

**we noticed that both character vector and factor vector
do not have mean**

```{r}
